My name is Jack Morrris I a first year PhD student in the [theory group](https://cstheory.ucsd.edu/home.html) at UCSD! Previously, I spent two years as a software engineer at Google in the Bay Area. Before that I was an undergraduate in math at UCLA.

My research interests are at the intersection of complexity theory and quantum computing. I am particularly interested in circuit complexity, Hamiltonian complexity, and quantum information theory. Broadly, I am interested in many aspects of theoretical computer science.
