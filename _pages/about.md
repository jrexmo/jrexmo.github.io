My name is Jackson Morrris I am currently a software engineer at Google in the Bay Area and was previously an undergraduate in math at UCLA. My research interests complexity theory, learning theory, and quantum computing. Lately, I have also been very interested in the role of randomness in computation. Broadly, I am interested in many aspects of theoretical computer science.
