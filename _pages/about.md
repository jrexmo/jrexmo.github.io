My name is Jack Morrris I am an incoming PhD student in the [theory group](https://cstheory.ucsd.edu/home.html) at UCSD! Previously, I spent two years as a software engineer at Google in the Bay Area. Before that I was an undergraduate in math at UCLA.

My research interests include complexity theory and quantum computing. Lately, I have also been very interested in the role of randomness in computation. Broadly, I am interested in many aspects of theoretical computer science.
